<h2>What is a User Story?</h2>
- An artifact that represents…
  - the needs, benefits and/or experience desired
  - a placeholder of conversation
  - an item of business value
- Provides enough detail for an initial estimate and evolves as additional details emerge
- An input to planning for a roadmap and/or iterative work plan

User stories should be written to represent a unit of work using the **INVEST** criteria.

**I - Independent**
The user story should be self-contained and written to have a minimum of dependencies

**N - Negotiable**	
User stories are written as conversation placeholders and can be updated or negotiated up until they are placed in a sprint

**V - Valuable**	
A user story must deliver value to the end user or customer

**E - Estimatable**	
You must always be able to estimate the size of a user story.

**S	- Small**	
User stories should be sized appropriately with near term stories broken up small enough to be completed in a sprint

**T -	Testable**	
User stories should be able to be tested as either “Pass” or “Fail” for acceptance

<h2>What does a Story Writer do?</h2>
- Ask questions!
- Seek to understand the goals and value proposition to the user
- Define and communicate “what” the user experience should be
  - Including content, design, functionality, etc.
- Support the delivery team through implementation and act as a point person for questions
- Can also help in validating that the functionality meets the goal
