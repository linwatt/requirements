More on Just-in-Time Requirements:
- Requirements aren’t analyzed or defined until they are needed. 
- Only a small initial investment is required at the start. 
- Development is allowed to begin with incomplete requirements. 
- Analysis and requirements definition is continuous throughout the project. 
- Requirements are continuously refined as the project moves forward. 
- Change is expected and easy to incorporate into requirements. 

How much is enough?: 
- Base it on velocity.
- Workshop stories with the developer(s) to get an understanding of what can get done. 
- Play it safe and inflate the velocity/estimate to be sure you have enough for planning and empty cycles.
- Breaking apart stories will likely need to happen after you have all the requirements. Stories tend to balloon.

Write your stories with the acceptance criteria defined by the client. 
Rinse and repeat.
