Even if the client doesn’t know exactly what they want, they can still talk for hours about it. The goal at this stage is to gather up all the **visions** (ideas, comments, loosely defined slop) and keep adding to it until they can’t think of anything else. 

<h2>Things you should ask</h2>
- What problem(s) are we trying to solve?
- Who is this vision for?
- What is this vision for? (Web, iOS, Android, etc.)
- Is this building off an existing system or using existing software/APIs?
- Are there technical and/or UI standards?
- Can you clarify that piece?

<h2>Things you should capture</h2>
- Good visions
- Bad visions
- Freaking terrible visions
- Visions that are so outrageous they’ll never fit in the time or budget limits
- What that guy said even though the other guy rolled his eyes
- **#Everything**
