It’s time to break those visions down to high level requirements and group them as best you can into epics. The format depends on organizational standards, if it’s a deliverable, ease of presentation, personal preference, etc. 

Examples:
- Mind Map
- Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
  - TIP: This will help in the next step!
  - Format:
    - Epics
      - Description
    - Features
      - High Level or Stories
      
<h2>Back to the Stakeholders</h2>
Back to the stakeholders! Have them define the “what” and “when” of your epics and high level features.

    - Guide them on dependencies
      - We want profile settings first!
      - Prereqs:
        - Registration
        - Login
- Required vs Nice-to-Have features
    - MoSCoW rating
- Gather any dangling visions
