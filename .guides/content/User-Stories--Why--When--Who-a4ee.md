<h2>Why do we write User Stories?</h2>
- Because they clearly communicate to all involved what the user experience should be in a way that anyone can understand
- To define in business terms, the benefit or value proposition
- To provide a benchmark for what success looks like when the feature is complete or “done”

<h2>When do we write User Stories?</h2>
- Anytime there is a request for a feature or deliverable during the life of a project
- Start with high level stories called “Epics”
  - With progressive understanding and elaboration, Epics are broken down into smaller “child” stories
- Analysts use the Product Backlog(s) to prioritize their elaboration and stay ahead of delivery
  - This is done through Backlog Grooming, User Story Workshops, JAD Sessions, etc.
