We know what they want, we know who it’s for, what’s the deal? 
**Let’s build this thing!**

**Stop!**
Let me tell you why we’re not ready:
- Poorly defined requirements can (read: will) prolong the development effort
  - Scope Creep
- How do we know what to do first?
  - Get the priorities straight
  - Required vs. Nice-to-Have
- Important questions become very difficult to answer: “What’s done?”, “When can we release it?”, “How long will this take?”
