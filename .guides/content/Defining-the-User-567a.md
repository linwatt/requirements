The target audience drives functionality, usability, content, etc., so defining the user roles is a crucial step to requirements gathering. Some organizations create names, ages, and backstories for the roles while others simply define what “user” means in the context of that project.

Examples:
Blog: Blogger, Visitor, Administrator
eCommerce Site: Seller, Buyer

To find out who the target users and customers are:
- Ask the client!
- Online & Field Research
- Assumed Profiles

When to find it out:
- ASAP
- When gathering visions
- During initial story writing

Personas/roles can be revisited and refined throughout the project. 
New users can appear with new functionality (e.g. “Oh yeah, marketing wants a portal to see usage statistics..”).
