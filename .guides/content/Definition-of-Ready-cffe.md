The definition of ready is the measure for when a story is considered eligible for planning. This is defined at a team level.
- Story is documented with acceptance criteria
- Any designs, assets, etc. are provided
- Story is sized by the team
- Story deemed ready by the Product Owner

If the team has estimated a Story to have a very large size, it will need to be broken down into smaller stories.
