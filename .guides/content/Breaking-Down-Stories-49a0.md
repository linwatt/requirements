Some effective ways of splitting and/or breaking down user stories:
- Across Data Boundaries
  - Data/Fields (#1 Name & Address and #2 Phone)
- On Operational Boundaries
  - CRUD (Create, Read, Update, & Delete)
- Remove Cross Cutting Concerns
  - Error handling via login
- Separate Functional and Non-Functional
  - Make it work, then make it better 
    - #1 I want to login, #2 I want a time out if no response in 2 minutes
- Split Stories of Mixed Priority
  - #1 login using name and password, #2 time out or email with login information
